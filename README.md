2. [Enter Txstate Password]...
3. [Open a window on Eros] ssh [TXState ID]@eros.cs.txstate.edu
4. [Open a window on Zeus] ssh [TXState ID]@zeus.cs.txstate.edu
5. [Compile and run the following on Eros first]
gcc -o s server_tcp.c
./s
6. [Combine and run the following on Zeus]
gcc -o c client_tcp.c
./c eros.cs.txstate.edu
